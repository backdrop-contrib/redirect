This is the new module home for a unified redirection API (also replaces
path_redirect and globalredirect).

* Initial Backdrop Port

there are some flags in the code in areas where I believe some action is required,
but I did not know the correct action.

those areas are flagged: 
* TODO
* BACKDROP_INITIAL_PORT
